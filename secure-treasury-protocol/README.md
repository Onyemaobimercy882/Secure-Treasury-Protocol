## Overview

The Multi-signature Treasury Management System is designed for DAOs, organizations, and collectives that require secure, transparent, and decentralized control over shared funds. By implementing a multi-signature approval process, the system ensures that no single individual can unilaterally control the treasury, reducing the risk of fraud, theft, or mismanagement.

## Features

### Multi-signature Controls
- **Configurable Threshold**: Customizable number of required signatures for proposal approval
- **Signer Management**: Add or remove authorized signers through collective approval
- **Transparent Voting**: All votes are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Proposal System**: Structured process for fund allocation and treasury management

### Treasury Operations
- **Secure Fund Storage**: All funds are held in the contract until approved for transfer
- **Proposal-based Transfers**: Funds can only be transferred after meeting signature threshold
- **Deposit Tracking**: Transparent record of all deposits to the treasury
- **Balance Monitoring**: Real-time treasury balance information

### Governance & Security
- **Proposal Lifecycle**: Create, vote, execute, or cancel proposals
- **Emergency Controls**: Special protections for emergency situations
- **Expiration Mechanism**: Proposals automatically expire if not executed within timeframe
- **Role-based Access**: Different capabilities for signers, proposers, and administrators

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Data Storage
- **Signers Map**: Records authorized signers and their status
- **Proposals Map**: Stores proposal details including votes and execution status
- **Proposal Votes Map**: Tracks individual votes on each proposal
- **Signer Proposals Map**: Stores special data for signer management proposals

#### Proposal Flow
\`\`\`
1. Signer creates proposal
2. Other signers vote on proposal
3. When threshold is reached, proposal can be executed
4. Funds transfer or governance change is executed
\`\`\`

#### Proposal Types
- **Transfer**: Move funds from treasury to specified recipient
- **Add Signer**: Add new authorized signer to the treasury
- **Remove Signer**: Remove existing signer from authorization
- **Change Threshold**: Modify the required signature threshold
